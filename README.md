# Emergency Ambulance Services Application

## Overview
This mobile application aims to address the inefficiencies of ambulance services in India. It is built using **Flutter**, **Dart**, and **Firebase**, and aims to connect users with the nearest ambulance services, ensuring timely medical help during emergencies. The app uses real-time GPS tracking for ambulance dispatch and offers additional features such as ambulance type selection and live video support for attendants. 

> **Note:** Currently, the project is in its early development stages. The login and sign-up screens have been developed, and user verification is done through Firebase. Further development, including the integration of real-time ambulance tracking and other features, is in progress.

## Problem Statement
